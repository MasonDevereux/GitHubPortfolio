Title: Original Character Design - An Alien Robot Named Earl

Software Used: Procreate

At 17 years old, I digitally created this floating alien robot that I like to call Earl. I have used Earl for many digital projects, two of which are linked below. The first link is a storyboard, and the second link is an animatic created from that storyboard.

Title: Original Character Sheet

Date Completed: July 19, 2022

Software Used: Procreate and Krita

Artist: Mason Devereux, age 17

I created this character as the central figure for a video game idea that I had. This creature lives in the center of the Earth, and one day ventures far away from home and falls down a deep pit to find themselves in the sewers of New York City. The enitre video game progresses as this character has to find their way home, traveling across America through cities, farms, casinos, mountains, gas stations, hotels, and deserts.

## Graphic Design

![WigoDesign](https://github.com/MasonDevereux/masondevereux.github.io/blob/3D-Models/IMG-1497.JPG?raw=true "WigoDesign")

At 18 years old, I used digital vector-based illustration software to fully conceptualize an idea I had for a mobile app called Wigo. I designed the logo along with all of the icons and created a presentation for the app. The design work above was used in this presenatation, along with other Wigo designs I created to demonstrate what the app would accomplish and features that it would include.

Date Completed: June 5, 2023

Software Used: Adobe Illustrator, Vectornator, Curve, and Procreate.

I designed a poetry book as an assignment for college Graphic Design class. While I didn't personally write the poems or take the photos, I searched for poetry and photography that followed an overarching theme and wove the two artistic bodies together. This assignement helped not only as an exercise in layout, but also in color and visual unity.
